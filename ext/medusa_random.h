/* 
   Generator    Relative Execution Time

   ran0     1.0
   ran1     1.3
   ran2     2.0
   ran3     0.6
   ran4     4.0

   On balance, we recommend ran1 for general use. It is portable, based on Park
   and Miller's Minimal Standard generator with an additional shuffle, and has
   no known (to us) flaws other than period exhaustion.  If you are generating
   more than 100,000,000 random numbers in a single calculation (that is, more
   than about 5% of ran1's period), we recommend the use of ran2, with its much
   longer period.

   Knuth's subtractive routine ran3 seems to be the timing winner among portable
   routines. Unfortunately the subtractive method is not so well studied, and
   not a standard. We like to keep ran3 in reserve for a "second opinion,"
   substituting it when we suspect another generator of introducing unwanted
   correlations into a calculation.

   The routine ran4 generates extremely good random deviates, and has some other
   nice properties, but it is slow. See ยง7.5 for discussion.  Finally, the quick
   and dirty in-line generators ranqd1 and ranqd2 are very fast, but they are
   somewhat machine dependent, and at best only as good as a 32----bit linear
   congruential generator ever is ------ in our view not good enough in many
   situations.  We would use these only in very special cases, where speed is
   critical.
